Data source and processing
--------------------------
Data were downloaded from the ENCODE comparative chromatin page as a BED file
(specifically, `this file
<http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/modencode/webpage/hic/HiC_EL.bed>`_).  These
data in turn are from Sexton et al., "Three-dimensional folding and functional
organization principles of the Drosophila genome", Cell (2012).

The original BED file contains four different classes of domains: active, HP1
centromeric, Null, and PcG.  These were split into multiple bigBed files for
better visualization in the browser.
