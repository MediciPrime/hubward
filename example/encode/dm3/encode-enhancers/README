Data were downloaded from https://www.encodeproject.org/comparative/chromatin
as text files with chromosome and position.  BED3 files were created by
extending the position by 1 bp, and BED3 files were converted to bigBed format.

From the site::

    Enhancers were identified using TSS-distal DHSs and p300 and CBP-1 binding
    sites. The positions listed in the files are a subset of TSS-distal DHSs
    (human, fly), p300 (human) and CBP-1 (worm) binding sites that are
    classified as enhancers...  ...The classification was optimized to obtain
    a high confidence set that is not necessarily very inclusive. For
    additional information please see the README file in the archive.
