            adding a new track hub in the UCSC Genome Browser.
    email:
        type: string
        description: |
            UCSC requests that email is included on track hubs so they can
            track usage.

        description: |
            Configuration for uploading tracks and track hub to a server over
            rsync, called as `rsync <locally-prepared track hub>
