            Short label for this group. This text will be found in the blue
            section headers in the UCSC Genome Browser.

        type: string
        description: |
            Upon being uploaded to the server, this is the URL by which the hub
            can be accessed. It is the URL to be pasted into the text box when
            adding a new track hub in the UCSC Genome Browser.
    email:
        type: string
        description: |
            UCSC requests that email is included on track hubs so they can
            track usage.

    server:
        type: object
        description: |
            Configuration for uploading tracks and track hub to a server over
            rsync, called as `rsync <locally-prepared track hub>
            <user>@<host>:<hub_remote>`. If deleted, empty, or set to empty
            strings, then you'll need to provide these details on the command
            line when calling `hubward upload`. Those command line arguments
            also override the corresponding option configured here.
        properties:

            host:
                type: string
                description: |
                    Host name where tracks will be rsynced. Override at command line with `--host <HOST>`.

                type: string
                description: |

                description: |
                    Path on `host` to rsync the track hub `hub.txt` file. This
                    file is expected to be served and accessible via the
                    `hub_url` configured above. Override at command line with
                    `--hub_remote <FILENAME>`.
